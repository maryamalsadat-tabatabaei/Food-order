# Meal Order
This is a simple meal-ordering React application that allows users to browse a menu, add items to their cart, and specify the quantity of each item. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing food orders. <br>

## Project Background
This project is based on Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's tutorial on Udemy React Practical Guide. I have made some modifications to the original project and I built upon that foundation to extend the project's functionality and address specific requirements. However, the course inspired the core concept and initial implementation and the work of the original author.
